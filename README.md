# Traffic Density Monitoring using OpenCV

## Aim
To detect vehicles from aerial drone footage using background subtraction and contour detection and classify traffic density.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Method
1. Background subtraction (MOG2)
2. Thresholding
3. Morphological operations
4. Contour detection
5. Area filtering
6. Density classification

## Output
The system detects moving vehicles and classifies traffic as Low, Medium, or High.

## Limitations
- Cannot detect stationary vehicles reliably.
- Sensitive to lighting and camera movement.
